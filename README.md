This repository provides a simple Python script to load and read PyTorch .pt files. The script uses the torch.load() function to load a PyTorch file from a specified path and outputs the contents in a human-readable format using Pythonâ€™s standard print function. This is especially useful for inspecting the contents of model checkpoints, tensors, or other PyTorch objects saved in .pt files. By making the data easily accessible, this tool helps users gain insight into saved models and data without needing to reload them in a complex machine learning pipeline. The script is lightweight and requires only PyTorch as a dependency.
